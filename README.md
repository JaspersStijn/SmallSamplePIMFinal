# Introduction

R package related to 'Covariate-adjusted generalized pairwise comparisons in small samples', by Jaspers, Verbeeck and Thas (2024). Semiparametric Probabilistic Index Models allow for the com-
parison of two groups of observations, whilst adjusting for covariates, thereby fitting nicely within the framework of Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. In this paper, we
show that the parameters of the Probabilistic Index Model can be estimated using Generalized Estimating Equations, for which adjustments exist that lead to estimators of the
sandwich variance-covariance matrix with improved finite sample properties and that can deal with bias due to separa-
tion. In this way, appropriate inference.
